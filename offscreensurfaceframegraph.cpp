/*
 * An overview of the frame graph used by this class:
 *
 *                 (1)| RenderTargetSelector |
 *                               |
 *                      +=================+
 *                      V                 V
 *              (2)| ClearBuffers |  (3)| Viewport |
 *                                           V
 *                                  (4)| CameraSelector |
 *
 * To summarise the Qt3D documentation, the frame graph is processed in depth-first order.
 * Each node sets some state. Therefore you can read the graph as saying:
 * "Given the action for this node, perform the actions of each of its children in order."
 *
 * 1. The render target selector sets the current render target (an OpenGL texture buffer).
 * 2. The specified buffers (here, colour and depth) are cleared.
 * 3. The viewport area to render into is set up.
 * 4. The appropriate camera is chosen.
 *
 * Further children can be added to the render target selector in order to perform subsequent
 * actions. In this example project, the offscreen engine adds a render capture node after
 * the existing children in the frame graph.
 *
 * An example extension of the framegraph can be the one that draws an image in the background:
